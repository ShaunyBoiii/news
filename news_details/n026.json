    "full_article":"How do we begin to covet, dear readers? Do we seek out things to covet? If so, we have just the thing for you - a new 4K restoration of The Silence Of The Lambs. It's been 33 years since Jonathan Demme's seminal psychological thriller brought Sir Anthony Hopkins' calculating cannibal and Jodie Foster's driven FBI rookie Clarice Starling to the big screen — and still those lambs have not stopped screaming. Now, Arrow Video are preparing to release a glorious-looking new feature-packed 4K edition of the serial-killer classic. Set to release next month, we have an exclusive trailer to share with you for their upcoming re-release of Demme's disturbing opus. Grab some fava beans and a nice chianti.Based on Thomas Harris' 1988 crime thriller novel, Demme's five-time Oscar-winning film sees FBI newbie Clarice Starling (Foster) caught in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with a deranged serial killer nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill' (Ted Levine). In order to crack the case, Clarice turns to a monster — Hopkins' man-munching, malevolent psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter — to help catch a monster, excavating her own deep-rooted psychological trauma in the process. A taut thriller driven by career best turns from Foster and Hopkins, laced with heart-in-mouth sequences of potent horror — 'It rubs the lotion...'; the intense night-vision climax; Lecter's bloody prison break — The Silence Of The Lambs endures as one of the the 20th century's great masterworks.The Silence Of The Lambs is available on 4K UHD and Blu-ray from 26 August from Arrow Video.",
