    "title": "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Trailer Takes Tim Burton And Michael Keaton Back To The Afterlife",
    "full_article":"It's been a while since we've seen Tim Burton channelling his early mischief - the sort of weird, wonderful whimsy that was a hallmark of the first decade of his career. But in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, that magic looks to be back - with the latest trailer teasing a spooky and sprightly romp through the afterlife. Michael Keaton is grouching up a storm as the ghoulish bio-exorcist, there's puppetry galore, a church dance sequence, and all kinds of grisly sight gags, decked out in sweetly gothic get-up. So, a Tim Burton movie, then. Watch the latest trailer here:This latest look at the film offers a bit more plot - with Jenna Ortega's incoming Astrid Deetz raising the spectre of Beetlejuice once more, Winona Ryder's Lydia dealing with the fallout, and Beetlejuice himself causing chaos at the centre of it all. And, as predicted, Keaton looks to be having an absolute blast here, slipping effortlessly back into that striped suit. Plus, we see Monica Bellucci's mysterious Delores stapling herself back together and sucking the life of out people; an army of shrunken-headed underworld workers; plenty of stop-motion-styled animation work... It's been years since we've seen Burton working on this kind of register.We'll find out whether Beetlejuice Beetlejuice was worth the 35 year wait when it hits UK cinemas on 6 September - following its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival at the end of August.",
