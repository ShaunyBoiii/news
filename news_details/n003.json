    "full_article":"After what feels like an eternity, the wait is almost over for the Merc with a mouth and everyone's favourite adamantium-clawed badass' MCU debut in Shawn Levy's r-rated blockbuster Deadpool & Wolverine. We've already been promised the hotly anticipated Deadpool trilogy capper will be, and we quote, 'the most Deadpool movie in the history of Deadpool,' a multiversal meta romp loaded with crude humour, cameos galore, ultra violence, and, er, Britain's ugliest dog. But in the newly released final trailer for the Marvel movie, we get to see Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds put a pin in the banter for a moment as Deadpool and Wolverine reflect on their purpose and face their pasts together. It's surprisingly emotional stuff, so bring tissues (not in that way!).LFG? More like LFGTT (Let's F*cking Go To Therapy) — that one got us right in the feels. From Reynolds' Wade Wilson getting vulnerable and opening up about his found family, to Jackman's James 'Logan' Howlett mentioning how Scott — aka Scott Summers, aka X-Men's Cyclops — used to beg him to wear the yellow X-Man suit, there's an elegiac quality to this latest trailer that really goes hard. It's an emotional, character-driven clip that suggests beneath all the meta japes and dick jokes, Deadpool & Wolverine will be as much a reckoning with these characters' collectivised trauma and inner struggles as a nerdgasmic opportunity to see two comic book titans team up/square off. When Jackman told Empire we'd see sides of Wolverine we've never seen before here, he wasn't kidding!But despite the more sombre vibe to this final trailer, there is also room for some real 'Holy shit!' reveals to drive the Deadpool & Wolverine hype into overdrive, too. Glimpses of Asgard! A first proper look at Lady Deadpool (flanked, it seems, by a slew of other Deadpool variants)! Pyro and Sabretooth! 'Pool thwipping, Spidey style! More of Emma Corrin's Cassandra Nova, seemingly spaghettifying whole realities à la Loki! And, of course, the genuinely unexpected return of Dafne Keene's X-23 from Logan, whose 'You were always the wrong guy — until you weren't...' seems to have coincided with a mass bout of hayfever in the Empire offices. Weird!Basically, the TL;DR version of all this is Deadpool & Wolverine looks like everything Marvel fans have been waiting for and then some. Catch us first in the line at the cinema, chimichangas in hand, when Deadpool & Wolverine releases on 25 July. Less than a week to go, folks!",
